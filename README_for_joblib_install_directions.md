only for windows, linux/unix users (sorry) but you will have to figure this out on your own - google it

to install joblib LOCALLY and not have it installed globally which is nice for the easy cleanup when deleting the files...

do the following to install joblib locally:

cd in the joblib-0.11/ directtory

the type:
	
	python setup.py install --user

(of course python must be installed on the system and in the PATH)
